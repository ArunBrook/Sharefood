Share Food - Food Sharing Platform
Share Food is a location-based platform developed using Django, Python, Bootstrap, SQLite, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a MAP API. The core mission of Share Food is to significantly reduce food wastage and create a zero-waste food ecosystem. The platform provides a marketplace for farmers to sell their produce, hotels to offer surplus and specialty foods, and users to share food items for free or for a price. Authorized authorities help redirect food resources efficiently.
